            "description": "Morphine is a potent opioid analgesic used to relieve moderate to severe pain. It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord to reduce the perception of pain. Morphine is available in various forms including tablets, liquid solutions, injectables, and suppositories. It is often used in clinical settings, especially for cancer pain, post-surgical pain, and palliative care."
